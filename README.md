# Testing your code
We have a situation whereas each member uses different OS to build and compile project. My suggestion is all of us installing g++ on our machine and use my `output.txt` in `test` folder to compile our project.

1. Change directory to `test/` folder
2. Make sure you mark `output.txt` is excuetable on your OS
  * On linux, `chmod +x output.txt`

3. To run, just have to run `./output.txt` in a terminal window.
